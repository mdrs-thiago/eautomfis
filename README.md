# e-AutoMFIS

Code repository for the article "Automatic generation of fuzzy inference systems for multivariate time series forecasting", submited to the Fuzzy Sets & Systems Journal. 

The e-AutoMFIS model was designed for multivariate time-series forecasting using an ensemble learning of automatic Fuzzy Inference System. The code provides the object **eAutoMFIS**, to be used for training and prediction. 


**Important note:** this repository contains only the code for the **eAutoMFIS** model, which can be used similarly to the `scikit-learn` models. It's highly recommendable to create your own data preprocessing before using the **eAutoMFIS**.
